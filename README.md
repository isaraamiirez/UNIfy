UNIfy is an application that aims to help and facilitate the students that have doubts in their university choice.

Our application has two main functions:

  - Filtering universities by characteristics.

  - Helping users to choose universities that matches the most their personality.


## INSTALLATION

To be able to run our app you will need to have installed:

  - Python proggraming language - It will work with version 3
  - In order to run our program you will need to have installed the following libraries: tkinter, functools and heapq_max

Once everything is installed, you can open the file called "" and run the program.

## USAGE

The first thing the user must do is to login to the app by typing the username and password. 

The user will have two main option to choose:

  - Filtering universities by characteristics 

  - Find the university that matches you the most

**Filter:**

  - The user will be asked which characteristic they want to filter the universities by.
  - The user types in the filter they want to set and the system will display different options  regarding the previously selected filter. 
  - The user will have to choose the option they find most appealing. The system will allow the user to add many filters to the search. 
  - Once the characteristics have been selected and the user doesn't want to select more filters, the user types ‘no’.
  - The system will show the user the universities that match the filters that have been selected previously.

**Find the university that matches you the most:**

  - The app will provide the user with a questionnaire with questions related to his or her personality in order to know his or her tastes and preferences.The questionnaire has 7 different questions, each one about a different quality such as spirit, person type, team work, study type, study fields, annual budget and language.
  - The questions will be asked one by one and each one will give the user a number of possible answers (from 2 to 5) so that he/she can choose which of these options he/she identifies with the most. 
  - Once the test has been taken, the system will evaluate all the answers and, according to these, will provide the user with the university that best suits him/her.
  - If the user wants to apply to the choosen university, the app will provide you with the contact information of the university.
