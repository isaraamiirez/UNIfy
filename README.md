# Project Name: UNIfy

The university application process is a dreadful and inefficient one due to the fact that the students suffer from information failure. Meaning they don’t have all the knowledge they need available when it comes to what university is best tailored to their needs and interests. 

‘UNIfy’ is a student-founded application that came about from analysing the problems we faced when attempting to find the best university for ourselves. 

Our application has two main functions:

  - **Function 1:** Filtering universities by characteristics.

  - **Function 2:** Helping users to choose universities that matches the most their personality.


## INSTALLATION

To be able to run our app you will need to have installed:

  - Python proggraming language - It will work with version 3
  - In order to run our program you will need to have installed the following libraries: tkinter, functools and heapq_max.

Once everything is installed, you can open the file called "app_code.py" and run the program.

## USAGE

The first thing the user must do is to login to the app by typing the username and password. 

The user will have two main option to choose:

  - Filtering universities by characteristics. 

  - Find the university that matches you the most.

**Filter:**

  - The user will be asked which characteristics they want to filter the universities by such as study type, public or private, study fields, location, annual budget or language.
  - The user types in the filter they want to set and the system will display different options  regarding the previously selected filter. 
  - The user will have to choose the option they find most appealing. The system will allow the user to add many filters to the search. 
  - Once the characteristics have been selected and the user doesn't want to select more filters, the user types ‘no’.
  - The system will show the user the universities that match the filters that have been selected previously.

**Find the university that matches you the most:**

  - The app will provide the user with a questionnaire with questions related to his or her personality in order to know his or her tastes and preferences.The questionnaire has 7 different questions, each one about a different quality such as spirit, person type, team work, study type, study fields, annual budget and language.
  - The questions will be asked one by one and each one will give the user a number of possible answers (from 2 to 5) so that he/she can choose which of these options he/she identifies with the most. 
  - Once the test has been taken, the system will evaluate all the answers and, according to these, will provide the user with the university that best suits him/her.
  - If the user wants to apply to the choosen university, the app will provide you with the contact information of the university.
